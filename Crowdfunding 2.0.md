As a crowdfunding supporter, I want to support a project more than what I can personally consume, and I want to benefit financially together with the project, not just consume its output.
Also, once I make the pre-payment, this crowdfunding 2.0 gives me ability to use that value, trade it, pay other things with it, unlike crowdfunding 1.0 where I am stuck waiting. Also, I want to be a supporter even if I don't have money but by relating my own productive output.
