1. You want to buy product Y from seller X. You are producing yourself other things of value that other people want. You would like to use that future income to buy product Y from seller X, but without waiting, without having savings, or without going into debt. 
2. Seller X does not know you and/or does not want any of your products, so you can't barter with them. 
3. UnTap finds EDN (economic deep network) flows where your future income from others becomes instant payment for seller X, without anyone going into debt.
